# Teaming up for a Co-Op project

If you have ever formed a study group, trying to juggle between opinions and make sure everyone is included in the discussion and work with them all the way to the end of the semester. It is an experience similar to what most of us call *team-player* in the soft skills of our CV's and resumes. Unlike  most of us think, we usually don't own the necessary experience to call ourselves a good team player.

## So what does it really mean?

[Reading this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html), a student called Rozovsky had the chance to experience *"proper"* teamwork skills in a carefully crafted curriculum by Yale School of Management. 

> A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee.

Trying to get it all, and multi-task in between whenever necessary is a must. But apparently that was not even close to the expected results Rozovsky had to endure. Between increasing stress and conflicted leadership it was apparent that there is more to team work than proving who had the right to say.

Being of a close and similar backgrounds had proven fatal to the experience, and contrary to popular thoughts. Instead it seems that striving for diversity in backgrounds was in fact the proper way to go.

## What is going on then behind the curtains?
> In God we trust, all others must bring data. - W. Edwards Deming

Being in a data driven world, and in an age where personalities and data merges to produce great results in personal understanding. Which information has never been as accessible as now, provided much needed insight to our problem.

At the beginning, companies tended to abuse the data by micromanaging it's own employees for the best result through "employee performance optimization" did not work as intended. In fact most productivity was found with higher interactivity between peers and co-workers, which can only exist in an accommodating environment. An existing model that tries to teach the concept is within the course of ***Pair Programming***.

## When did the trend finally took off?

So google, *the mother of all data*, had this idea in 2011, and tried to find everything about it by literally spending unknown millions of dollars just to build the perfect team. If anyone could do it, I guess google would. And so came the results with the following: 
-Employees with large rotational networks tended to be most productive
-Managers with least micromanaging but good communications did the best job.
So in 2012, our person of interest became a graduate, was interested in people’s habits and tendencies, and was eventually hired by google at that very timely chance.

Data from at least 50 years was gathered, and no stone was unturned when it came to team work.

```
Project Aristotle’s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? Or did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google:

  How often did teammates socialize outside the office? 
  Did they have the same hobbies? 
  Were their educational backgrounds similar? 
  Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? 

They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals. They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.
```
But nothing worked, even when data seemed to match in terms of background and makeups, the results resembled the contrast of black and white.

Well, except for an ambiguous concept, that is similar to cultural norms, but on a micro scale of groups, such as when the group would enforce sharing of ideas, or cutting each other when necessary. 

With that in mind, tons of patterns emerged, and with tons of patters and no decisive answer, it was good as no pattern at all.

## But an outlier with group and individual IQ was so interesting
It became it's own topic, and was such a decisive rule of thumb that it defined google's work ethics and had a hard line drawn whenever a [top performing employee tempted it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber).

The results of testing equal though sharing spoke for themselves, with emerging teams showing high social sensitivity and therefore higher individual participation on average, and raising the total IQ than what a single person could ever reach in a group of silent employees.

Psychological safety describes your ability to talk and act on calculated risk among the team without the fear of retribution or recourse. 

## So what does it take to apply it?

Three years of data, surveys and the feedback of `51.000` google employees. And a mid level manager who used to be in a **SWAT** team, an electronics salesman and now a mid level manager at his mid 40's.

So what he did, he made it very personal. Without the survey asking him to do anything, and it worked. Barriers were crushed and every bit of detail of work was discussed overnight. 

I did realize that I had so much `work face` wearing me down while I worked my way through internships, some of it is my fault with minimal communication but the culture and language was too contrasting with my own to be otherwise. I had strived to loosen the tension until it eventually had some results with the latest work.

# And what did google do? 
Our protagonist came to the same conclusion, and sought to remind what google's effort came to too.

> ‘‘Just having data that proves to people that these things are worth paying attention to sometimes is the most important step in getting them to actually pay attention, don’t underestimate the power of giving people a common platform and operating language.’’ -Rozovsky
