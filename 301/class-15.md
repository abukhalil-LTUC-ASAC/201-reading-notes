# Where are the women in tech?

I have been wondering about that for a long time, for an occupation that has no extreme work hazards, relatively stable and has good income it would seem obvious that the gender tech graduate gap would not be equal to 20%, barely double percentage of those who are working in [construction](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/28/heres-what-its-like-to-be-a-woman-construction-worker.html#:~:text=Currently%2C%20women%20make%20up%209.1,male%20counterparts%20make%20across%20industries.)) where none of that is present!

Apparently the reasons touted in [the article](https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/) is that gaming had  a major role in learning programming effectively. And that role got slashed, when marketing started targeting boys in games (most famous example used here [Game Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy)), right after the gaming industry crashed as an act of desperation.

>From then on, a kind of chicken-and-egg cycle took hold. Advertisers sold games to boys because boys were the ones buying them, and boys were the ones buying them because of the advertisers’ targeted marketing. It’s no coincidence that the console touted to have saved the industry was called a “Game Boy.”

Being held up against a dominant male culture was quite intimidating for most women who even had measurable experience and equal footing into this field, and thus [obstacles seem to pile](https://fortune.com/2015/04/20/the-pervasive-bias-against-female-computer-science-majors/) on as long as the narrative stays at it is.

# What about other issues in tech?

[The data](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/) clearly shows gaps in top tech companies, although the data is quite biased to the very top of skilled and achieving individuals there are striking numbers relating to latinos/blacks who are 6-7 times less representative among these companies, while asians seem to have the opposite data.

But this seems misleading as this [article explains](https://www.wired.com/story/tech-leadership-race-problem/).

>“Some people call it unconscious bias. For Asians, it’s actually a very conscious bias,” says Gee. Studies show that assumptions that Asians are good at math, science, and technology make it easier for them to get in the door, but the same bias is reversed when it comes to leadership roles, he says.

# So what to do about them?

There seems to be a shift towards embracing diversity as a solution to biased recruitment and promotions, these take shape in various forms and for various reasons. An idea is to take the will to change to upper management, and convince them to take helm on the issue, so some [statistical data](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/) showed these results.

- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative: As if subtle and occasional friction in thoughts and idea exchanges are what sparks innovation.

- Diverse companies perform better: 
>And in a 2003 study looking at 177 banks across the U.S., researchers found that for banks focused on innovation, racial diversity was clearly tied to better financial performance. Research also links gender representation at the executive and board level with better company performance.  

- Companies are losing out on great talent: for the obvious reason of unjustified dismissal and general unattractiveness to applicants.

- Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base: As a more recent argument against twitter is to hire more from the black population to effectively help with their issues on that very platform.

- And finally, because it is the right thing to do:
>Some of these leaders have noted that the tech industry is creating vast opportunity and that by excluding certain groups from that opportunity the industry is perpetuating and exacerbating existing social inequality. Others have emphasized a concern that by failing to involve particular communities in the process of creating of new technology, we as a society lose out on the benefits of those community members’ ideas.
