The backbone of JS backend, it is time to get introduced to the [everything in the internet world](https://medium.com/commencis/javascript-is-everywhere-really-906d1cf06092). You probably heard of it as a hot backend for tech companies who are after the most recent technologies. Others simply call it the [Javascript Runtime](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3210589/what-is-nodejs-javascript-runtime-explained.html). 

There is another aspect of JS, that it has an [open standard](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5520245/is-javascript-an-open-source-project), might try something with IOT using it.

Best part is that it gets excellent support, being part of the v8 engine development that is also the latest, duh.
It also is what we know as `npm`.

The rest is where you'd want to develop your skills on, wether to build front or backend, mobile or desktop or even IOT using its own engine in JS. It is truly everywhere.
